## Overview

I built a responsive landing page for Huddle, a community-focused platform that encourages user engagement and interaction. The page aims to capture attention with its bold colors, friendly visuals, and clear call to action.

- A clean and modern landing page showcasing an inviting hero section, descriptive text, and an eye-catching mockup illustration.

- A register button that triggers a friendly JavaScript alert to simulate user interaction.

- Social media icons with hover states to encourage users to connect on different platforms.

- Responsive layout using flexbox, ensuring good display on large screens (desktop-first).

### The challenge

I didnâ€™t face major challenges on this build â€” the structure was straightforward, and working with flexbox and background images felt natural thanks to prior practice.

## My process

- Started by structuring the page in HTML with clearly separated sections (header, hero, info, social links, footer).

- Styled the page using CSS with flexbox for easy horizontal layout and good spacing between elements.

- Used background images and color overlays to achieve the vibrant purple theme.

- Integrated Font Awesome icons to easily display social links with smooth hover effects.

- Added a small JavaScript snippet to handle button click feedback for better user experience.

### Built with

- HTML5 â€” semantic structure and accessibility considerations

- CSS3 â€” flexbox layout, background images, custom button styles, hover effects

- Font Awesome â€” for scalable and accessible social media icons

- JavaScript (Vanilla) â€” for handling user interaction on the register button
